# Aperture

This is the documentation repository for the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code
**Aperture**. The documentation is hosted using Github Pages at:
[http://fizban007.github.io/Aperture4_docs/](http://fizban007.github.io/Aperture4_docs/).

## Documentation Development

This documentation is based on the Python library
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), with some markdown extensions. To develop the
documentation, you need to install the following Python libraries:

``` sh
$ pip install mkdocs pymdown-extensions
```

Then, clone this repository, and run `mkdocs serve` in its root directory. This
will start a development server at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. Any changes you
make to the documentation can be seen in the browser in real time.
